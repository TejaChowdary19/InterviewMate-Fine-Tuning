Q: What programming languages should an AI engineer know?
A: Python is essential, followed by C++, Java, and R depending on the domain.
Q: What is the role of an AI engineer in a product team?
A: They build and deploy machine learning models that enhance product features or optimize internal systems.
Q: What frameworks are commonly used by AI engineers?
A: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, and Hugging Face Transformers are widely used.
Q: How do AI engineers evaluate model performance?
A: They use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC depending on the task.
Q: What's the difference between data scientists and AI engineers?
A: Data scientists analyze and model data, while AI engineers productionize and scale those models.
Q: What is model fine-tuning?
A: Itâ€™s the process of adapting a pre-trained model to a specific task using task-specific data.
Q: Why is vectorization important in AI?
A: Vectorization speeds up computation and is essential for neural networks and similarity searches.
Q: What are transformer models?
A: They are deep learning models designed to handle sequential data using self-attention mechanisms.
Q: What is inference latency?
A: It's the time a model takes to generate a prediction after receiving an input.
Q: How do AI engineers use vector databases?
A: For storing and querying high-dimensional embeddings in tasks like semantic search or retrieval-augmented generation.
