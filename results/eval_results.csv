Google Maps has been the most popular map app in the US since its launch in April.
Launching on the iOS app on 2 October, the app allows users to access maps using keystrokes.

Google Maps allows third-party applications to access user data without exposing passwords, using algorithms like mark-and-sweep.
Users can also access maps using keywords like ""user,"" ""map,"" ""userdata,"" and ""data.""

Google Maps uses cookies to improve user experience. Users can change their settings using a link in the app.
Users can also access maps using API requests.
